# About The Project
Teaming up with <a href="https://unitedwaytopeka.org/">United Way</a>, a group and I where asked a question: In areas with higher median household income, will there be more
food resources available in that area than areas with lower median income?
To answer this question, our group decided to collect data from the Google Places API and from the Census Bureau. After collecting the data we would create a <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/adipersio#!/vizhome/TopekaFoodResouces/Dashboard?publish=yes">Tableau page</a> to visulize what we had collected and show our findings to <a href="https://unitedwaytopeka.org/">United Way</a>. Lastly, our group wanted to make a machine learning model for the data to test the inital question.
